Testlet7210,"Moonbows</h1>Look up after a summer shower, and you may see a magnificent arc of color that nature has painted across the sky. It&#8217;s a rainbow! This amazing sight appears when sunlight passes through droplets of water. As the sunlight hits a raindrop, it bends and separates into the rainbow's band of multiple colors. Most people have seen a rainbow, usually after an early morning or  late afternoon rain shower.</div>"
Testlet7210,"Did you know that rainbows can sometimes also be seen at night? A nighttime rainbow, called a moonbow, is a rare event. It occurs only on a clear, rainy night when the moon is almost full.  A moonbow appears when moonlight passes through a light rain or mist. Just like sunlight, the moonlight bends and separates into colors. However, since the moon is not as bright as the sun, the colors of a moonbow are very faint, often appearing white to the human eye.</div>"
Testlet7210,"There are very few places in the world that a moonbow can be seen. One of these places is Yosemite National Park. The park&#8217;s many waterfalls help create just the right conditions for a moonbow to appear. Mist from the falling waters gets caught in the light from the moon, creating the moonbow. For those fortunate enough to witness this beautiful sight, it is truly an unforgettable experience.</div>"

I am pleased to contribute to the discussion on the quality and safety of bottled water. Today we are releasing our study on bottled water in the United States. The study shows that over 10 years, Americans&#8217; consumption of bottled water has doubled. <u>In 2008 alone, Americans drank 8.6 billion gallons of bottled water. This</u></div>"
Testlet1100008,"<u>increase is despite the fact that bottled water costs consumers as much as 1,900 times more than tap water. It also takes up to 2,000 times more energy to manufacture and transport the product.</u></div>In spite of the growing popularity of bottled water, questions remain regarding its quality and safety. Consumers have little way of knowing where the water in their bottles comes from or how it has been treated. A recent poll showed that many people drink bottled water because they believe it is safer or healthier than is tap water. However, water quality testing shows little evidence that bottled water contains lower levels of contaminants than tap water contains.</div>"

Because bottled water is treated as a food, it is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), not the EPA. Companies that make bottled water must list basic ingredients and nutritional information on their labels.

Because the pieces always turned in the same direction, people could now rely on the first magnetic compasses.

Testlet1100009,"<div class='paraTitle'>Magnetized Needles</div>By the eighth century, scholars had contrived a way to magnetize iron needles by rubbing them with a lodestone. In the eleventh century, magnetized needles were floated in a bowl of water with edge markings, and the resulting device was referred to as a wet compass. Further improvements led to a boxed compass, which was very similar to the modern compass; this type of compass was more portable, making it useful for navigational purposes.</div>"

Testlet1100009,"<div class='paraTitle'>How a Compass Works</div>A compass operates by utilizing Earth&#8217;s natural magnetism. When a compass is held out steadily, its magnetized needle aligns with Earth&#8217;s magnetic lines of force and points approximately north. With the invention of the compass, navigators could instantly discern north, prompting people to refer to compasses as &#8220;the eyes of sailors.&#8221;</div><div class='paraTitle'>Effects on History</div>Before the compass, mariners stayed close to the land and relied on visible landmarks. The invention of the compass opened the door to a new era by allowing mariners to venture out into the open sea.

A long, uninterrupted recess awaits them, and visions of lazy days dance through their thoughts. Yet, when summer arrives, it is often accompanied by boredom and lack of intellectual stimulation. The typical <br/>eleven-week break during the summer months brings with it many disadvantages, including decreased recollection of information learned the previous year. There is a solution to these: year-round school. Year-round school has a great number of</div>"
Testlet1120000131,"advantages, and more schools should adopt this type of program.</div>In the typical academic calendar, students attend school approximately 180 days of the year. They have a couple of weeks off in the winter, a week off in the spring, and then 11 to 12 weeks off in the summer. In year-round schools, students attend school 180 days as well, but they only attend for 45 days at a time followed by 15 days off. The usual holiday and seasonal breaks are built into the schedule.</div>In 2014, there were 3,181 year-round schools in the United States, which means approximately 10 percent of the students who attended public school followed a year-round</div>"
Testlet1120000131,calendar. A recent survey of parents with students in year-round school found that  80 percent were satisfied with their school&#8217;s schedule. They reported that daycare was still available for children during breaks and that travel was less expensive during off-peak times. Schools reported fewer absences because teachers and students had frequent breaks that eased fatigue and encouraged rejuvenation. Students often returned to the classroom with renewed energy and enthusiasm.</div>Some studies suggest that struggling students perform better in year-round schools because they can use breaks in the calendar for review and enrichment. The North Carolina Department of Public</div>
Testlet1120000131,"Instruction studied 345,000 public schools, and the students in year-round schools had achievement levels similar to those in traditional schools. Ohio State University performed a recent analysis and found no significant difference in reading and math achievement between traditional and<br/>year-round schools. The State of California Department of Education reported that third graders in the state who went to year-round school improved 9.5 percent on standardized tests, and students&#8217; reading scores rose 13.3 percent. There is increasing national interest in nontraditional school schedules. Further, many foreign countries use year-round school calendars.</div>"
Testlet1120000131,"Class sizes are smaller in year-round schools that use a &#8220;multi-track&#8221; system, in which students are divided into groups, and different groups attend at different times in the month. Costs are reduced in these school districts because buildings are used constantly rather than standing empty, and teachers earn more by teaching more weeks of the year. With all these benefits, schools ought to review the research on year-round schools when planning their calendars. Perhaps this method will be the revolutionary change education systems need.</div>"

When women first declared their rights at the famous Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, they were concerned, among other things, with the right to work and also the right to keep any money they earned. At the time, in almost every state, women&#8217;s wages legally belonged either to their fathers or to their husbands. Since that time, women have not only been granted those rights but other rights in the realm of work, including the right to work in traditionally male-dominated fields.

It is also influenced by several other factors including occupation. Women still, on average, earn less than men, no matter what job they do.

But what, exactly, is a geyser, and how does it work?</div><div class='paraTitle'>How Geysers Start</div>Our Earth consists of many regions where magma, or hot lava, lies beneath the surface. This magma works like a burner on a stove, heating any water in the ground until it grows very hot. Most water beneath Earth&#8217;s surface comes from rain and melting snow. This water passes through cracks in the earth and collects underground. If this water lies close enough to hot magma, it heats and begins to boil.</div>"
Testlet1100006,"If no constrictions keep it from rising, the boiling water becomes a hot spring, slowly <u>percolating</u> up to the surface and collecting in a steaming pool or flowing off as a small stream. In the case of geysers, the underground water contains dissolved minerals called silica. As the hot water boils beneath the ground, it carries the silica through narrow passages below the surface. Like runny, wet cement, the silica coats the walls of these passages, and, over time, it makes them narrower.</div>Just like a teakettle with boiling water inside and only a tiny hole on top, the heated water reaches a point where it is under intense pressure and must escape the narrow passages in a huge explosion of hot water</div>"

However, most geologists will concur that even Old Faithful&#8217;s eruptions really can&#8217;t be predicted with complete accuracy. It erupts once every 45 to 125 minutes, never at a specific time. The average is once every 90 minutes, but even this has not been a very predictable number over the years. Back in the 1930s, Old Faithful eruptions averaged about every 66.5 minutes.

Officially named Saint Stephen&#8217;s tower, the clock tower is 316 feet tall, or eleven stories high.

However, brain scans indicate that people who write to-do lists by hand are likely to remember what is on their lists, even if they never look at it again. According to Professor Virginia Berninger of the University of Washington, writing by hand activates a much larger portion of the brain&#8217;s thinking, language, and working memory regions than typing.

As humans, we all want to imagine that we would have courage to act in risky situations: to stand up to a black bear threatening a hiker, to rush into a burning building to rescue a child, to confront an unpleasant boss who is taking merciless advantage of workers. However, these admirable actions are usually accomplished only by the courageous few because, in the moment when courageous action is called for, many of us succumb to fear and fail to act. Do courageous people experience fear, too? Or are they&mdash;somehow&mdash;fearless?</div>"
Testlet1120000141,"Merriam-Webster&#8217;s dictionary defines courage as &#8220;mental or moral strength to venture, persevere, and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty,&#8221; thus acknowledging that even the courageous feel fear. However, www.dictionary.com disagrees. This source defines courage as &#8220;the quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger, pain, etc., without fear.&#8221;</div>Many of our cultural icons reinforce the idea that courage is the equivalent of fearlessness. Celebrity heroes dash to the rescue without a moment&#8217;s pause. Imagine the absurdity of Superman shivering with fear before taking down his enemy.

The misleading cultural fiction that heroes are fearless may deter potential heroes from action. Perhaps they ponder their pounding hearts and sweaty palms and chide themselves for not having heroic qualities.</div>Shouldn&#8217;t our culture be encouraging heroes, reassuring them that their fears are normal and do not preclude heroic action? When faced with a deadly snake, every human in existence experiences fear, but according to Joseph LeDoux, a professor of neuroscience at New York University, people register particular threats differently. When humans</div>"
Testlet1120000141,"do react to an imminent danger, however, their physical reactions are similar. Our hearts race, our palms sweat, and our guts feel empty. These sensations are the result of two signals that are sent to the brain. The first signal travels to the amygdala, a region near the base of the brain, and causes us to freeze or jump. The second signal is sent to the hypothalamus, which triggers the autonomic nervous system and triggers the physiological symptoms, also known as the fight-or-flight response.</div>Franklin D. Roosevelt, the thirty-second president of the United States, had it right when he said, &#8220;Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear.&#8221;</div>"

Testlet1110007,"Why Are There No Saxophones in the Orchestra?</h1>The saxophone is an unusual instrument. Like an oboe or clarinet, it has a reed, which creates a vibrating effect when air is forced through the mouthpiece. Like a trumpet or French horn, the body of the saxophone is brass, which generates a blustery blare. As a cross between a woodwind and a brass, where does the saxophone fit into the orchestra? In most classical symphony orchestras, nowhere!</div>Saxophones feature significantly in high school marching bands. While they&#8217;re important in jazz, rhythm and blues, and</div>"
Testlet1110007,"popular music, they appear so infrequently in orchestral music that few professional orchestras employ full-time saxophonists. Instead, when one number in a classical concert requires a saxophone, orchestras may engage someone locally or assign another band member&mdash;perhaps a<br/>clarinetist&mdash;to play saxophone temporarily. With saxophones prominent in other types of music, what explains their conspicuous absence from the orchestra?</div><div class='paraTitle'>Late Bloomer</div>The saxophone was a <u>late bloomer</u> in the classical orchestra garden. By the 1840s when it was invented, the makeup of symphony orchestras was pretty well established. These ensembles had sections of brass (such as </div>"
Testlet1110007,"trumpets), woodwinds (such as oboes), percussion (such as drums), and strings (such as violins), much like orchestras today. Mozart, Beethoven, and other classical composers wrote for the orchestras of their time. Although modern orchestras are bigger, to perform music by Mozart and Beethoven, they need to contain similar instruments.</div>Adolphe Sax grew up helping his father make musical instruments for a living. He noticed that the loud brass instruments tended to overpower the woodwinds, which overpowered the strings. To try to balance the sound, he invented an instrument that combined characteristics of woodwinds and brass. He introduced his saxophone at the Paris Industrial Exhibition of 1844 and</div>"
Testlet1110007,"promoted its adoption by French military bands in place of oboes, bassoons, and French horns. After his band, including saxophones, won a competition against the French Army band using traditional instruments, the saxophone became a standard feature of marching bands.</div>New musical genres incorporated the new instrument, which participated in jazz bands from 1914. Fans could have heard the sax in any jazz club in the Roaring Twenties; dancers could have swung to it in any dance hall in the Big Band era. But concertgoers could not have found it in most programs at any classical concert hall. Because their repertory still emphasized music composed before Sax created his woodwind-brass hybrid,</div>"
Testlet1110007,"orchestras did not engage saxophonists, and music schools did not train them. Composers, in turn, rarely wrote saxophones into their music because orchestras might lack trained musicians to perform it.</div><div class='paraTitle'>No Shrinking Violet</div>The saxophone wails, moans, and sobs. It can howl at the moon or whisper in melancholy tones. One saxophonist advises his students to view their instrument not as a machine but as an extension of their vocal cords. Naturally loud and expressive, slightly imprecise in pitch and rhythm, the sax stands out in a crowd. That suits the flamboyant flair of a marching band or the improvisational spirit of a jazz combo, but players must work at toning it down&mdash;and staying exactly on the beat</div>"
Testlet1110007,"without <u>dragging</u> or <u>rushing</u>&mdash;to blend inconspicuously into an orchestra. The sax wants to solo.</div>In fact, the most famous orchestral numbers that include a saxophone use it as a solo instrument within a larger composition such as Ravel&#8217;s <i>Bolero</i>, Prokofiev&#8217;s <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Mussorgsky&#8217;s <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i>, or Rachmaninoff&#8217;s <i>Symphonic Dances</i>.

American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the surface of the moon, took photographs, and collected extensive lunar samples to bring back to Earth. The mission fulfilled a national goal set by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 and was, in part, a response to a race with the Soviet Union to lead in space exploration. An estimated 530 million people watched televised scenes of different aspects of the mission, including Armstrong&#8217;s first step upon the moon. The following excerpt comes from an award-winning paper that University of California librarian Anne Platoff presented at the 1992 annual meeting of the North American Vexillological Association, a group that studies flags. In her paper, Platoff discusses the historical significance of placing the U.S. flag on the moon.</i></div>"
Testlet1320000381,"Where No Flag Has Gone Before: Political and Technical Aspects of Placing a Flag on the Moon<span class='author'>by Anne Platoff</span></h1>During their historic extravehicular activity, the Apollo 11 crew planted the flag of the United States on the lunar surface. This flag-raising was strictly a symbolic activity, as the United Nations Treaty on Outer Space precluded any territorial claim. Nevertheless, there were domestic and international debates over the appropriateness of the event. Congress amended the agency&#8217;s appropriations bill to prevent the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) from placing flags of other nations, or those of international</div>"
Testlet1320000381,"associations, on the Moon during missions funded solely by the United States. Like any activity in space exploration, the Apollo <br/>flag-raising also provided NASA engineers with an interesting technical challenge.

Therefore, raising a flag on the lunar surface would merely be a symbolic <br/>gesture&mdash;an expression of triumph similar to the planting of a flag on Mount Everest or at the North and South Poles. The legal status of the Moon clearly would not be affected by the presence of a U.S. flag on the surface, but NASA was aware of the international controversy that might occur as a result.</div>In January of 1969, President Richard M.

Testlet1120009,"Percival Lowell and Pluto</h1>Sometimes you don&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re looking for, but you find something even more remarkable. Percival Lowell spent years looking for evidence of life on Mars, and in that pursuit, he found evidence of a new planet&mdash;Planet X as he termed it. Planet X would turn out to be Pluto, the ninth and smallest planet in our solar system until it was <u>demoted</u> to a dwarf planet in 2006. The story of Lowell and Pluto is one of scientific innovation and science&#8217;s continual need to verify its findings and, when necessary, correct its mistakes.</div>"
Testlet1120009,"Percival Lowell was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1855 to one of America&#8217;s aristocratic families. Educated at Harvard, Lowell had an intense curiosity about the world, which took him to places such as Japan and Korea, and resulted in his publication of a book of images from Korea, a first in the United States. During his late thirties, inspired by the writings of French and Italian astronomers, Lowell embarked on the journey that would occupy his remaining years: looking for evidence that there was life on the planet Mars. In 1894 he established the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, on &#8220;Mars Hill.&#8221; He also ordered the construction of a high-powered, cutting-edge telescope so he could study the &#8220;Red Planet.&#8221; Lowell was</div>"
Testlet1120009,"convinced that the canals visible on <br/>Mars&mdash;scientists would later define them more precisely as channels&mdash;had been created by inhabitants of the planet as a form of irrigation and drainage system to control the melting water from the polar ice caps. His three books based on his observations of Mars captured the imagination of the American public.</div>In the early 1900s, Lowell was also studying anomalies he saw in the positions of Uranus and Neptune. Lowell became convinced that there had to be another planet&mdash;Planet X, he called it&mdash;beyond Neptune that accounted for the inconsistencies he was recording. Lowell died in 1916 at his observatory while trying to</div>"
Testlet1120009,"prove the existence of Planet X. Fourteen years later, a young astronomer named Clyde Tombaugh working at the Lowell Observatory would photograph and identify Planet X, which was then named Pluto.</div>Pluto is 3.68 billion miles from the sun, is extremely cold (300–400 degrees below zero), and is a mere 1,400 miles wide&mdash;about one-half as wide as the United States. Pluto has an elliptical orbit, which means that rather than having a nearly circular shape like Earth&#8217;s orbit, Pluto&#8217;s orbit is more like an oval racetrack. The region of the sky where Pluto is located is called the Kuiper Belt, where rock and ice debris, believed to have originated when the solar system formed, orbits. This is</div>"
Testlet1120009,"what caused all the controversy over whether or not Pluto is a planet.</div>In 2003, astronomer Mike Brown discovered an object (later named Eris) in the Kuiper Belt that was about the same size as Pluto. This raised important questions for astronomers: Was Eris the tenth planet? If not, how could Pluto, so similar in size, still be considered a planet? In 2006, the International Astronomical Union <u>demoted</u> Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, which is an orbiting object that, while similar to planets, is smaller than Mercury (the smallest planet). So, in the course of a century, Percival Lowell&#8217;s elusive Planet X went from being declared the ninth</div>"

Testlet1120005,"Second: Much of what Socialism teaches will be put to the test by society anyhow, for society is based on interest, on financial considerations, and it has been found very long ago, that co-operation cheapens products, while steadying employment.</div>Third: As a working system Socialism is based on the limited intellectual powers of a large number of people who will not receive systematic instruction, or cannot. Any large school shows how large the proportion of children is who must eventually be, as adults, members of this number, and, by exercising their right to vote for their officers and leaders, will make a scientific and economical management exceedingly difficult, if not</div>"

In order to obtain the best results, however, a</div>"

We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by . . . bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs&#8217; cheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O&#8217;Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our</div>"
Testlet1320000321,"native land. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes. Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I myself did not understand.

Then he instructed Ithenhiela to gather a stone, a clod of earth, a piece of moss, and the branch of a tree before they embarked on their journey. Ithenhiela could only nod, for his mind still lay mired in the dark pond of his past.</div>The sun set only twice before Ithenhiela found himself on Hottah&#8217;s back, traveling beyond the Too-Cha-Tes River and Hottah&#8217;s ancestral lands, and galloping over the vast ocean of undulating grasses beyond which lay the West. Scarcely had they reached the plains, however, when, like a ghostly phantom, Naba-Cha appeared on his giant caribou just behind them.

This analogy brought home to the young man the fact that he himself had no cloak, and that the overcoat in which he had faced the relatively temperate airs of Boston seemed no thicker than a sheet of paper on the bleak heights of Northridge.

Bearded dragons got their name because of how they look.</div>Bearded dragons are a type of lizard that people often keep as pets. These creatures are tan and yellow in color, and they have spikes on their throat and along the sides of their head and body. They can grow as long as 13 to 24 inches, including their tail. In</div>"
Testlet5140,"fact, their tail can be longer than the rest of their body!</div>When bearded dragons sense danger, they flare out the skin around their chin. This becomes their &#8220;beard.&#8221; The beard is not hairy but is instead covered with spiky scales. Bearded dragons display their beard to attract mates and to defend themselves against predators. Both males and females have a beard, but males show their beard more often.</div>"

Testlet5240,Airplane Ear</h1>So many people have difficulty with their ears when traveling by plane that the problem has a name&mdash;<br/>airplane ear.</div>There are changes in air pressure when a plane takes off and lands. The change can cause a small area inside the middle of the ear to fill with air.  This &#8220;air pocket&#8221; creates a blocked feeling that can hurt.</div>
Testlet5240,"There are a few things you can do to help your aching ears. First, keep swallowing. You can do this anytime during a flight. If you do this just as the plane takes off, however, you might prevent the problem. Next, chewing gum can be helpful because it forces you to swallow frequently. Finally, if swallowing doesn&#8217;t help, try yawning. With all of these methods, you should feel a pop in your ears. This means that air is passing out of the pocket and the pain is easing.</div>"

Sometimes the bags get recycled, but more often,</div>"
Testlet5250,"shoppers just throw them out. Have you stopped to think about where these paper bags come from? That&#8217;s right, from trees! Putting paper bags in the trash is like pouring milk down the drain before you drink it. It&#8217;s a problem because it is wasting a valuable resource.</div>But it&#8217;s not a hard problem to solve. At most grocery stores, you can now buy reusable shopping bags. These bags cost very little and are sturdy. They can be used for a long, long time.</div>"
Testlet5250,"Every time I go to the grocery store with my family, we bring our reusable shopping bags. I feel good about doing a small thing that can help save trees. Let&#8217;s all do it!</div>Kim Hwang</div>"
Testlet5260,"Cars of the Future</h1>In science fiction stories, characters often zip around in flying cars. Well, science fiction will probably soon be fact! Engineers have invented a new way to travel. Their idea combines flying and driving. This invention can take off into the sky like a plane. After it lands, it folds up its wings and is ready for the driver to drive it down the road.</div>"
Testlet5260,"Now, get ready for another amazing automobile that is different from the flying car. This one barely needs a driver at all! It can start, stop, and steer without any help from a driver. Yes, that&#8217;s right. The car is packed with computer software, cameras, and other gear. They give information about the locations of other cars, directions, speed limits, and more. So, the rider can sit back and enjoy a good book. Maybe science fiction would be a good choice!</div>"
Testlet5320,"What Is Killing the Honeybees?</h1><div class='paraTitle'>Honeybees Are Dying</div>Honeybees live in groups called colonies. Around 2006, many colonies seemed to be dying. Experts did not know why. But they were worried. Honeybees play a large role in how we get the food we eat.</div>"
Testlet5320,"<div class='paraTitle'>Honeybees Are Important</div>Honeybees are important for crop growth. They collect and move pollen. Pollen is a fine powder produced by the flowers of plants. As honeybees fly from plant to plant, they leave pollen behind. This pollen helps seeds form so that new crop plants grow. Without honeybees, we would not have many of the fruits and vegetables we eat.</div>"
Testlet5320,"<div class='paraTitle'>Possible Causes</div>A number of causes together may be killing honeybees. One is a type of parasite called a mite. A parasite is an animal that lives in other animals. This mite lives in honeybees and makes them weak. Farming chemicals may also be harming the honeybees. Finally, disease and changes in Earth&#8217;s weather could also be stressing them.</div>"
Testlet5300,"The Spectacular<br />Traveling Tern</h1>In some ways, the Arctic tern is an ordinary bird. It isn&#8217;t colorful like a peacock. (The tern is gray, white, and black.) It isn&#8217;t mighty like an eagle. (The tern is average sized, at about a foot long.)</div>In one way, though, the Arctic tern is truly spectacular. Every year, it migrates south from Greenland and other northern areas to Antarctica.</div>"
Testlet5300,"The journey is about 44,000 miles! That&#8217;s farther than any other bird travels. In its life, a tern may travel 1.5 million miles. That’s about three trips to the moon and back!</div>Until recently, scientists had no idea that Arctic terns travel so many miles. That&#8217;s when they made a tracking device small enough to fit on the bird. It showed that the terns don&#8217;t take a direct path south. They fly in an S-shaped path, probably to</div>"

The yearly Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is known as &#8220;The Last Great Race on Earth&#8221;&mdash;and for good reason.</div>"
Testlet610000370,"Teams from around the world make their way, day and night, over a windy, freezing, snow-covered route. They travel between the cities of Anchorage and Nome. They stop only to eat and rest briefly. The sport can be dangerous, but the thrill of the race keeps teams competing year after year.</div>"
Testlet610000370,"Honoring the Past</h1>The Iditarod race was created to honor an important part of Alaska&#8217;s history. Before trains, airplanes, and snowmobiles carried goods and mail, sled drivers and their dogs did those jobs. During one winter, dog sleds performed a critical deed that saved lives.</div>"
Testlet610000370,"In 1925, people in Nome, Alaska, came down with a serious   sickness. Medicine from faraway Anchorage, Alaska, was needed quickly. Tough weather conditions prevented airplanes from flying. So 20 sled-dog teams from across the territory took turns bringing the medicine part of the way. It took about five days for it to reach Nome. Today, Alaskans celebrate this feat with the yearly Iditarod race between the same two cities.</div>"
Testlet610000370,Very Special Teams</h1>Iditarod sled-dog teams are famous for their skills. The driver has a special bond with each dog and knows that dog&#8217;s skills very well. Each dog receives lots of training and is assigned to a position on the sled-dog line based on its strength and ability.</div>There are three types of sled dogs. Lead dogs are the fastest ones who can take charge. Immediately behind</div>
Testlet610000370,"them run the swing dogs, who help the driver steer through the many difficult and dangerous turns. The strongest dogs, called wheel dogs, run closest to the driver&#8217;s sled.</div>"
Testlet6200,"The Tiger and the Teacher</h1>Once upon a time, a tiger lived in the mountains of China. It was a very strong, powerful tiger, but it was also very clumsy. One day, the tiger admired a small cat that was racing gracefully up the mountainside. The tiger begged the cat to teach him how to climb the mountain.</div>The cat agreed to teach the tiger, but wisely would not teach all it knew because tigers cannot be trusted.</div>"
Testlet6200,"After months of lessons, the tiger became very skilled at climbing and catching animals. Instead of being grateful, the tiger decided to devour the cat.</div>The wary cat waited until the tiger pounced, and then the cat climbed quickly up a tree. The frustrated tiger yelled, &#8220;You did not teach me to climb trees!&#8221;</div>The cat replied, &#8220;You ungrateful creature! If I had taught you that, you</div>"
Testlet6200,would have eaten me by now.&#8221; The wise cat escaped by leaping from tree to tree.</div>
Testlet6140,"Catching Frogs</h1>You might imagine it&#8217;s a simple task to capture a little creature like a frog, but even if you follow these directions, you may find it&#8217;s not that simple after all.</div>First, locate a pond where there&#8217;s a lot of croaking going on. From the bank, look for little green heads poking out of the water, and single out the largest frog for your target. Then roll up your pants, remove your</div>"
Testlet6140,"shoes, and wade into the water gradually. Try not to startle the frog. Too late! The biggest frogs always jump the fastest.</div>So choose another frog. Step carefully and lift your feet high, but you&#8217;ll probably stumble over that fallen log anyway. Now that you&#8217;re thoroughly soaked, just go for it&mdash;dive and grab that slippery frog and clamber back up the bank.</div>"
Testlet6140,"Captured frog in hand, you can finally relax on dry land and put your shoes back on. But you need both hands to tie your shoelaces, so you gently place the frog on the ground beside you&mdash;but just for a moment. Sproing! The frog immediately leaps with a flourish back into the pond, but that&#8217;s exactly where a frog belongs anyway.</div>"
Testlet6220,"Twin Brothers</h1>Marco and Miles are identical twins, which means that they were born at the same time&mdash;well, just minutes apart&mdash;and that they look exactly alike. It is nearly impossible to tell the siblings apart. They both have auburn hair and green eyes, stand five feet tall, and weigh approximately 100 pounds each. They definitely have different personalities, though. Marco is passionate about soccer and video games. On the</div>"
Testlet6220,"other hand, Miles loves fishing and reading mysteries.</div>Everyone at school boasts that they can tell Miles and Marco apart. Becca brags that she can tell them apart from the freckles on their faces. She claims Miles has more freckles on his nose, while in contrast, Marco has more freckles on his cheeks.</div>Marco and Miles decided to test Becca. Marco is in Becca&#8217;s gym class, but Miles is not. So one day Miles </div>"
Testlet6220,"went to gym class in Marco&#8217;s place. Becca was clueless about the switch. When they played a basketball game, Becca hollered things like, &#8220;Marco, pass the ball to me!&#8221; and &#8220;Marco, I&#8217;m open!&#8221;</div>Becca sure was embarrassed when she found out about the switch. But she was not as embarrassed as Marco and Miles when the principal found out about the switch!</div>"
Testlet6130,"Andy Warhol</h1>Andy Warhol is one of the best-known pop artists of all time. &#8220;Pop art&#8221; is a type of art that first appeared in the 1950s and 1960s. It uses things from popular, or &#8220;pop,&#8221; culture as its subjects. When people first saw pop art, many wondered if it was truly art.</div>Warhol was born in 1928. As a boy, he became very ill. To keep busy, he drew pictures and read comics. He also loved movies and celebrities. After Warhol finished high school</div>"
Testlet6130,"in 1945, he went on to study art. In 1949, he moved to New York City, where he worked for a variety of magazine publishers.</div>In 1960, Warhol started to create paintings based on brand names and comic strips. For example, all of his life he loved canned soup. So he made hundreds of prints that showed soup cans. Some of his most famous paintings show the same subject repeated. One of these paintings is called <i>The Twenty-Five Marilyns</i>. Warhol made this painting</div>"
Testlet6130,"in 1962. It shows the same image of the actress Marilyn Monroe over and over again.</div>By 1968, Warhol was perhaps the best-known artist in the world. He died in 1987, but many people still love his work.</div>"
Testlet6210,"Three Days Away</h1>Jonah performed a final inspection of his room. He wanted to imprint every detail in his brain because he was going to be gone for three whole days. He peered inside Harold&#8217;s cage, where the hamster was running on its squeaky exercise wheel. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Harold. Mom will take good care of you,&#8221; Jonah said with a quiver in his voice.</div>Jonah grabbed his overstuffed backpack and headed to the car</div>"
Testlet6210,"with his mother. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to clean Harold&#8217;s cage and keep him well nourished,&#8221; Jonah reminded her.</div>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take excellent care of Harold,&#8221; Mom assured Jonah. She knew he was excited to visit his cousins, but he had never been away from home for more than one night. He seemed nervous, but he didn&#8217;t really want to talk to her about it.</div>As they drove, Mom reminded Jonah of all the activities he could do at the beach. He had to admit that he liked</div>"
Testlet6210,"the sound of swimming, boating, and even water-skiing. Maybe being away from home wouldn&#8217;t be so bad after all.</div>When they arrived at his aunt&#8217;s house, Jonah&#8217;s cousins ran straight out to greet him. &#8220;Jonah is finally here!&#8221; they shouted. As Jonah darted off with his cousins, his mom was relieved to see that his signs of nervousness seemed to have vanished.</div>"
Testlet6170,"Plant Reproduction</h1>Have you ever wondered where flowering plants come from? Most flowering plants reproduce by a method called cross-pollination. To understand how cross-pollination works, you need to understand the parts of a flower.</div>The stamen is the male part of a flower. The stamen has two parts: the anther and the filament. The anther produces pollen, which is what causes new plants to form and</div>"
Testlet6170,"grow.  The anther sits on top of the filament, or the stalk.</div>The pistil is the female part. It is usually located at the center of the flower. The pistil has three parts: the stigma, the style, and the ovary. The stigma is the upper tip of the pistil. It is sticky and captures pollen. The style is a tube that leads from the stigma to the ovary. The ovary stores ovules, which are like eggs.</div>When bees or other insects travel from flower to flower in search of</div>"
Testlet6170,"food, pollen sticks to their bodies. Some of this pollen may brush off onto the stigmas of other flowers the insects visit. This is how <br/>cross-pollination occurs. Pollen travels down the stigma to the ovary. When pollen and ovules come together, new seeds develop, which eventually may become new plants!</div>"
Testlet6120,"A New View</h1>Raul knew he was squinting and was consciously trying to stop, but his teacher noticed anyway. She frowned, asking, &#8220;Is everything okay, Raul?&#8221; Raul assured her that everything was just fine, but he continued to squint as he struggled to see what was written on the whiteboard.</div>At home that evening, Raul&#8217;s mom scolded him for sitting too close to</div>"
Testlet6120,"the television. And when she asked him to read the grocery list to her, she was really surprised at how close he held the paper to his face. She watched him with a look of concern.</div>&#8220;I&#8217;m calling the optometrist to make an appointment for an examination. You definitely need your eyes examined.&#8221; Raul protested, but his mother was uncompromising. Within a week, Raul had seen the optometrist, had the exam, and had a new pair of glasses.</div>"
Testlet6120,"&#8220;Everyone will tease me,&#8221; Raul whined in the car as his mother drove him to school.</div>His mother shook her head and told him he looked fabulous with or without glasses. At school, as soon as his mother drove away, he crammed the glasses into his shirt pocket.</div>During science, Raul and Kate were inspecting assorted seeds when Kate dropped one on the floor. Raul glanced down and realized it was</div>"
Testlet6120,"impossible to see the microscopic seed. With a sigh, he gave in and put on his glasses. Suddenly, everything came into focus! He looked down again and something caught his eye.</div>It was the seed along with some lint, discarded paper, and a pencil he had lost a week ago.</div>&#8220;Eureka!&#8221; Raul exclaimed. He handed the seed to Kate, who smiled and acknowledged his glasses with a tap to the frame. &#8220;They look good,&#8221; she</div>"
Testlet6120,"said, &#8220;and they give you bionic vision. Perfect!&#8221;</div>"
Testlet6190,"The Flight of the Golden Plover</h1>The golden plover is mostly a shore bird, but you won&#8217;t find it sitting idly on the beach. It nests close by in the grass, and it is a very industrious bird. Each year the plover&#8217;s flight is an extended one. The journey originates near the bottom of the world in South America and concludes in the Arctic, which is near the top.</div>For a bird to make such an extensive flight, you would think it must be</div>"
Testlet6190,"large and powerful. The plover is definitely strong, but it is not a very large bird. A full-grown plover is about the size of a robin, which is a relatively small bird.</div>Far above ground, the plover soars over countries and oceans. It flies over Peru, Colombia, and a strip of land in Mexico. Here and there, this energetic bird stops to rest and eat bugs and worms to give it strength to keep going.</div>"
Testlet6190,"The plover flies over the Gulf of Mexico and then crosses Texas. By the beginning of summer, this resilient bird is far north, in the Arctic. Here, the bird has a stopover, but only for the summer. Then what does it do? It turns around and heads south.</div>"

Testlet6100,"A Close Call</h1>Nora and Erin, best friends since kindergarten, bounded off the bus and hurried up the stairs to Nora&#8217;s second-floor apartment.

Testlet6230,"Becoming a United States Citizen</h1>If you are born in the United States, you are automatically a citizen. However, there are many people in the United States who were born in other countries. If you are one of these people, you can choose to become a citizen of the United States.

Testlet6000,"Crayfish</h1>Have you ever seen a mudbug or a spoondog? These are silly names for a crayfish which can also be called a crawfish or a crawdad. If you are ever exploring in a freshwater lake or pond, you may stumble upon these captivating creatures living in and around rocks in the shallow part of the water. Read on to learn how to recognize a crayfish.</div>"
Testlet6000,"A crayfish looks like a very small lobster or a really big shrimp. A common crayfish has a brownish red or brownish green body and large front claws. Like the lobster, a crayfish&#8217;s skeleton is on the outside of its body in the form of a hard shell. As the crayfish grows, its body becomes squished inside the shell. When this happens, the crayfish sheds the tight shell and forms a new one with more room. This is called molting.</div>"
Testlet6000,"The eyes of a crayfish are located on the tips of two short stems that poke out from its head. These eye stems can move all around which enables the crayfish to see in all directions. A crayfish has four pairs of walking legs and five pairs of swimmerets. Swimmerets are smaller than legs and are located underneath the crayfish&#8217;s body. They are used by the crayfish to keep water moving over its gills.  If a crayfish happens to lose a leg or a swimmeret, it grows a new one.</div>"

Testlet6260,"Formations in Limestone Caves</h1>Most caves are formed in limestone, a type of rock that easily dissolves over time. Caves form when rainwater seeps through cracks in the limestone. Sometimes, the water drips down through cracks. Other times, the water gushes. Over a long period of time, the limestone wears away, leaving a large empty space called a cave.</div>"
Testlet6260,"As water drips from the ceiling of a limestone cave, formations that look like icicles may appear. These formations are called stalactites. The stalactites grow in size and continue to drip water down to the ground of the cave. On the ground, a<br/>cone-shaped piece of rock begins to form. This formation is called a stalagmite. Sometimes a stalactite and stalagmite grow together. They form a kind of post called a pillar. Limestone pillars are a beautiful rock formation.</div>"
Testlet6260,"How does one remember which formation hangs down from the ceiling and which grows up from the ground? Note that the word <i>stalactite</i> includes the letter <i>c</i>. Think of <i>c</i> as standing for <i>ceiling.</i> The word <i>stalagmite</i> contains the letter g. Think of <i>g</i> as standing for <i>ground</i>. Thus, a stalactite hangs from the ceiling and a stalagmite grows from the ground.</div>"
Testlet6270,"Igloos</h1>Does an igloo become a shower when there&#8217;s heat inside it? Fortunately for those who use igloos, the answer is no. That is because of the way an igloo is made.</div>Building an igloo begins with cutting large blocks of snow. The blocks  are arranged in a large circle on the ground. A slightly smaller circle of blocks is laid on top of that, with those blocks leaning slightly inward. This circle is followed by another</div>"
Testlet6270,"smaller circle, and so on, until a final block of snow forms the top. After setting the blocks, the builder also uses a knife to help form smooth, curved walls and a round roof, or dome.</div>The oil lamps that are used to heat and light the inside of the igloo cause some melting. The bodies of people inside the igloo also add heat. Because the igloo is dome-shaped, however, the water does not drip down to the floor. Instead, the water flows down the sides. It soaks back</div>"
Testlet6270,"into the blocks. Then, as cool air from outside comes in through an entrance, the water from the melting snow refreezes. This melting and refreezing builds up an ice sheet, adding to the igloo&#8217;s strength.</div><div class='passageBody alignCenter'><img src='{cdnPath}/images/RC_L5_LM_133_tab_page3.svg' /></div>"

Testlet7110,"Getting to the Boston<br />Tea Party</h1>By December of 1773, relations between the British Parliament and the American Colonies were strained. This was especially true in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The problem was taxes, and the focus was on tea.</div>Six years earlier, the British Parliament had tried to flex its muscles to show the Americans who was in charge. Parliament passed the Townshend Acts.</div>"
Testlet7110,"These acts limited colonial authority. They set duties for the colonists to pay on common items such as paper, glass, and tea. For three years, the colonists protested these acts. They bought Dutch tea instead of British tea. Their protests worked. The acts, except for the tax on tea, ended in 1770.</div>Then in 1773, the British Parliament passed the Tea Act. On the surface, this act looked like a good deal for the Americans. The British East India Company was in trouble.</div>"
Testlet7110,"To help this company, the British government allowed it to sell tea in America at a low price. But the tax on tea was still in place. This made many Americans upset. The Tea Act seemed like just another way of making them pay a tax to Britain that they hadn’t agreed to. They protested more. They wanted to decide which taxes they would pay. In New York and other cities, agents who were supposed to accept tea from British ships refused to do so. Others resigned.  The ships couldn’t unload their tea.</div>In Massachusetts, a royal governor named Thomas Hutchinson decided that</div>"
Testlet7110,"three British ships would land in Boston. They would unload their tea there. But rebels in Boston had other plans. They’d protest against the East India Company and the British taxes by throwing the tea that was on the ships into the harbor.</div>On the night of December 16, 1773, about 60 American rebels gathered to put their plan in action. They most likely met in the newspaper offices of the <i>Boston Gazette and Country Journal</i>. Then, disguised as Mohawk Indians, they sneaked onto the ships. They tossed 642 chests of tea into the harbor. This act became known as the Boston Tea Party. It set in motion</div>"

Testlet7130,"Many people think that scuba tanks are filled with oxygen, but they&#8217;re not. The air inside a tank is like the air you normally breathe. The difference is that the air in a scuba tank is passed through a filter before going into the tank under pressure. A valve on the tank lets the air out slowly so the diver can safely breathe.</div>The gauge on a scuba tank lets the diver know how much air is left in that tank. Water temperature and swimming speed can affect how fast a diver breathes and how much air the diver uses with each</div>"
Testlet7130,"breath. A person diving in about 20 feet of warm, calm water might expect to use a tank of air in one hour. Different conditions can make for different results.</div>People have different reasons for scuba diving. Most people scuba dive because they want to have fun and enjoy the wonders of the life under the sea. Others dive as part of their job. These people include the underwater photographers who take the pictures that we see in magazines, in books, and on TV.</div>"
Testlet7130,"Some people dive to learn about the creatures that live in the sea and their habitats, while others dive to build or fix structures such as dams, bridges, and underwater habitats for humans. Some people dive to learn about how our planet was made, and others dive so they can study how our planet is changing. If you&#8217;re a fairly good swimmer, you should give scuba diving a try.

Testlet7100,"A Rebel&#8217;s Dream</h1>When Amelia Earhart was only six years old, history was made. For twelve seconds on December 17, 1903, Orville Wright flew through the air in a powered airplane. Though he flew only about one hundred feet, Wright had made a giant leap&mdash;modern aviation was born. Amelia Earhart was fascinated by flight. Although she was born at a time when women were expected to stay home with their families, Amelia Earhart was a rebel.</div>It was a shocking idea that a woman might want to fly. And although it made</div>"
Testlet7100,"her family quite unhappy, at age 24, Amelia Earhart learned to do just that. The following year, she bought her first airplane. She didn’t just want to fly. She wanted to be the best. She wanted to show the world that women could do much more than most thought they could. They could reach for the sky. They could fulfill even their wildest dreams if they dared. As a result of her hard work and determination, in 1928 Amelia Earhart became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an airplane.</div>Earhart became a hero, but she was uncomfortable with the fame that this</div>"
Testlet7100,"flight brought her. When she flew across the ocean in 1928, she was just a passenger. Two men actually flew the plane. Amelia wanted to prove that a woman could pilot a plane across the ocean by herself.</div>It took Earhart four years to realize her dream of flying by herself across the ocean. May 20, 1932, was the date she chose for her flight. It was a special date. Exactly five years earlier, Charles Lindbergh had made his famous flight across the Atlantic alone. He had flown from New York to Paris in 33.5 hours. From May 20 to 21, Amelia Earhart flew</div>"
Testlet7100,"solo from Canada to Ireland. She became only the second person in the world to fly across the Atlantic alone. She completed her flight in record time&mdash;14 hours, 56 minutes. Amelia Earhart had accomplished her dream. In addition, she inspired many women and girls to reach for their dreams, too.</div>"
Testlet7140,"Stranded!</h1>Never in his wildest dreams would Seth have believed that he’d end up stranded on an island with his parents and his younger sister, but that&#8217;s exactly what happened. That afternoon, they had missed boarding their tour boat. The boat had departed and wouldn’t return for another two days.</div>Now the sun was setting, and Seth saw that little Malia was near tears.

Testlet7160,"Too Many Catalogs</h1>To the Editor:</div>Today when I opened our mailbox, there were so many catalogs that it took me a full minute to pry them loose. I am under strict orders from my parents to toss each catalog into the recycling bin, so that&#8217;s what I did. I&#8217;ve dumped about ten catalogs into the bin over the past three days.

Testlet7160,"Each year, as seasons change, companies tailor their catalogs to the new holiday or season. Some companies send out a new catalog every week or month, and sometimes only the cover and a few pages are new. Some people read and order from catalogs, and some don&#8217;t, but eventually everyone gets rid of them. Many people recycle catalogs; others just throw them in the trash.

Testlet7220,"The Amazing Octopus</h1>You&#8217;ve probably seen movies with superheroes that have all kinds of amazing powers. Did you know that there is an underwater creature that can also do extraordinary things? It is an <br/>eight-armed creature known as the octopus. Just like superheroes, an octopus has many enemies.

Recently, however, scientists discovered that the opposite is true in large parts of the Amazon rain forest. Amazingly, dry times help the plants grow. When the rain stops, the Amazon comes to life. Scientists believe the deep roots of trees are the key. They reach water even in the dry season. The trees take advantage of the increased sunlight and thrive. More studies of the Amazon rain forest are expected to give researchers more surprises.</div>"
Testlet7180,"A New Way of Life</h1>In ancient times, horses lived on every continent. Then, over time, they disappeared from North and South America. No one will ever know why. Around the early 1500s, Spanish explorers brought horses back to the New World. Moving from the areas in and around what is now Mexico, horses carried explorers and colonizers north.

Testlet7200,"A World of Plastic</h1>Take a look around. You&#8217;re likely to see plastic everywhere. Plastic is in everything from the cars we drive to the water bottles we drink from. You could say that we live in a world of plastic.</div><div class='paraTitle'>A Brief History of Plastic</div>The word plastic comes from a Greek word meaning &#8220;capable of being shaped or molded.&#8221; An Englishman named Alexander Parkes patented the first plastic in 1856. He combined plant matter, called cellulose, with other materials. This created a new material.</div>"
Testlet7200,"It could be molded when heated. Just as important, it kept its shape when it cooled. By the early 1900s, different forms of plastic were in wide use.</div>The use of plastics exploded during World War II. Plastics could be light, flexible, and strong. This made them excellent for many military uses. Soon after the war, plastics makers turned out more everyday products. By the 1950s, plastics were used in a huge number of consumer goods.</div>"
Testlet7200,"<div class='paraTitle'>How Plastic Is Used Today</div>A list of plastics we use today would be nearly endless. Soda bottles, shopping bags, fleece clothing, and contact lenses are just a few examples. New plastics are being created and used in many technologies. In fact, it can be hard to find many products that aren&#8217;t made from plastic or that don&#8217;t use plastic in their production.</div><div class='paraTitle'>The Price of Plastic</div>Plastic products are relatively cheap to produce. They also make many activities more convenient. They do, however,</div>"
Testlet7200,"come at a price. Making plastic items often means using limited resources such as petroleum and natural gas. While we recycle many plastics, most take a long time to break down in landfills. Plastic production also often pollutes. Chemicals from plastics can get into water sources. The chemicals in some plastics have been linked to cancer. This means putting them into our environment can be deadly to all living things.</div>It is clear that in today&#8217;s world, we are dependent on plastic.

The Earth has gone through many cycles of getting hotter, and then getting cooler. However, the average temperatures on Earth are now higher than they have ever been.</div>Global warming is happening because of a change in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. The atmosphere is a layer of gases that surrounds the Earth and influences how much heat the Earth receives. Heat from the sun passes through the atmosphere</div>"
Testlet7000,"to get to the Earth. The Earth then absorbs most of this heat, but some of it bounces off the Earth and heads back out towards space. When the heat hits the atmosphere, most of it gets through. The atmosphere, though, stops some of the heat and sends it back to Earth again, which helps keep the Earth warm. The problem is that the atmosphere is getting thicker because of pollution. Cars, factories, and power plants creating carbon dioxide make some of this pollution. The thicker atmosphere causes more heat to return to Earth and less to go out to space. This results in warmer temperatures than usual.</div>"
Testlet7000,"Global warming is already causing problems. For example, warmer water in the world&#8217;s oceans is producing more hurricanes. Increasing temperatures are drying up soil and shrinking lakes. These changes are contributing to the drought in Africa.</div>Some people see global warming as the most important problem in the world today. Former Vice President Al Gore is devoted to educating the world about it. He has even been to China to talk about global warming. Mr. Gore suggests that people ride their bikes or take the bus.

Testlet8020,"From Beryl to Emerald</h1>Emeralds, dark green in color, are the most beautiful of all the gemstones. These unique gemstones are actually a variety of beryl, a hard, colorless mineral. Millions of years ago, emeralds formed deep underground. Magma, or melted rock, rose to the surface of the earth and then cooled to become granite. Granite is a kind of rock. Granite is made of different minerals, including beryl. Sometimes, beryl crystals in granite came into contact with other rocks that were rich in certain elements. If this</div>"
Testlet8020,"happened, the crystals turned deep green. Emeralds are green beryl crystals.</div>Beryl can also take on colors such as yellow or pink. Aquamarine is another variety of beryl. This gemstone is light blue. The light blue color occurred because a growing beryl crystal came into contact with other elements.</div>Emeralds have certain characteristics. An emerald is relatively clear. It has a glassy luster. The most prized emeralds have few imperfections. However, many emeralds contain tiny bubbles. Or they might contain foreign mineral crystals</div>"
Testlet8020,"such as salt. Scientists study these flaws to identify where an emerald was found.</div>So, where are emeralds found? Thousand of years ago, the first emeralds were mined in ancient Egypt. Today, the finest emeralds are mined in Colombia in South America. Emerald deposits also exist in India, South Africa, and North Carolina in the United States.</div>Natural emeralds are valuable because they are more rare than diamonds. One of the largest natural emeralds in the world is worth more than 2 million dollars. On the other hand, scientists are able to</div>"

However, Beethoven&#8217;s talent soon exceeded that of even his own musical heroes.</div>Beethoven&#8217;s success is even more impressive considering he was deaf for much of his adult life. According to some scholars, Beethoven&#8217;s hearing began to worsen when he was around thirty years old. His letters reveal that the first signs of trouble appeared even before that. In these letters he mentions hearing buzzing sounds when he was just twenty-six. By the time he was thirty, he found it hard to carry on conversations with others.</div>"
Testlet910000570,"Beethoven&#8217;s deafness had some <u>adverse</u> effects on his career. Although he continued composing, over time he lost the ability to perform concerts in public.

Testlet910000580,"The Importance of Avoiding Stress</h1>Over time, stress can make people feel exhausted and gloomy. It can frequently be difficult for people to determine exactly why they are feeling stressed. However, it is crucial to identify the source of any stress in one&#8217;s life so that it can be avoided whenever possible.</div>There are a number of ways to eliminate stress. Since stress is often the result of trying to do too much, it is healthy for people to drop some responsibilities if they are feeling overwhelmed. People</div>"
Testlet910000580,"can also say no to requests that could potentially cause stress. Other people might be disappointed, but personal well-being should always be the priority. When people do not expect too much of themselves, they can spend time doing what they enjoy instead of trying to do too many things at once.</div>"
Testlet910000580,"Coping with Stress:<br/>A Vital Life Skill</h1>There are many reasons someone may feel stressed out. Often, stress is the result of taking on more than usual. It is rarely hard to pinpoint its cause. A student who accepts a leading role in a play in addition to serving as class president and playing on a soccer team, for example, is likely to feel the pressure of this demanding schedule.</div>Should the student drop at least one of these activities to lighten the load? </div>"
Testlet910000580,"Contrary to what some people say, the answer may be no. Dropping activities can rob the student of the opportunity to feel a sense of accomplishment. Students should challenge themselves, but it&#8217;s still important to be realistic about what one person can reasonably take on.</div>Since stress is unavoidable for the majority of people, it is important to develop good coping techniques instead of trying to prevent all stress. Learning early in life to manage stress effectively may also increase young people&#8217;s chances for future success.</div>"
Testlet910000580,Those who excel in their chosen careers are often the ones who can calmly handle  practically anything that gets thrown their way.</div>
Testlet9090,"America Celebrates Its New President</h1>In February 1789, George Washington was chosen to be the first president of the United States. In March of the same year, the U.S. Constitution went into effect, and Congress sent word to Washington that he was officially elected. Fearing he would be a failure as president, Washington reluctantly left his home in Mount Vernon, Virginia, for New York City. It was there, in the new nation’s first capital, that Washington would be sworn into office.</div>"
Testlet9090,"Washington&#8217;s journey to New York took about seven days. It was accompanied by great fanfare. Celebrations broke out in numerous towns along the way. Crowds greeted him, and soldiers fired cannons to honor him. When Washington arrived in New Jersey, a barge that was decorated in red, white, and blue took him across the river to New York. There he was greeted by the mayor of the city, along with many other officers and citizens.</div>The celebrations continued until the inauguration took place on April 30, 1789.</div>"
Testlet9090,"On that day, Washington arrived at Federal Hall to be sworn into office. Huge crowds gathered in the streets to witness the event. Washington proceeded to a second-story balcony overlooking the city. Placing one hand on the Bible and one hand over his heart, he repeated the oath of office. When he finished, the crowds cheered, and bells rang throughout the city. Washington then entered the senate chamber, where the members of the new Congress sat, and gave a short speech. The inauguration ended that evening with a brilliant display of fireworks.</div>"

Other natives speak of a huge, stinking mouth located on the monster&#8217;s belly. Most natives agree that the hairy creature is at least seven feet tall when it stands upright on two legs. They also claim that it emits an extremely foul-smelling odor that pollutes the air wherever the creature appears.</div><div class='paraTitle'>Lost Creature or Myth?</div>Does the mapinguari exist, or is it a myth?

Testlet9120,"Les Mis&#233;rables</h1>In 1985, <i>Les Misérables</i> opened on the London stage. Based on a novel written by Victor Hugo, the all-musical play takes place in France during a time of great political turmoil. The show opens in a dismal French prison, where the main character, Jean Valjean, is freed after 19 years. Shortly after his release, Valjean meets a bishop who treats him with respect. Because of the kindness of the bishop, Valjean vows to become a new man.</div>"
Testlet9120,"The story is mainly about Valjean&#8217;s struggle to build a new life against tremendous odds. It also contains many subplots and stories of poverty and politics in nineteenth-century France.</div>For more than 30 years, <i>Les Mis&#233;rables</i> has been a sensation wherever it is produced. It has played in more than 250 cities in more than 40 countries. It is among the world&#8217;s longest running musicals. The original American production is one of the longest running musicals ever on Broadway.</div>"
Testlet9120,"Even today, the show continues to please audiences. Its story is timeless. Its characters are passionate and likeable. Its music is immediately appealing. For example, &#8220;On My Own&#8221; and &#8220;Bring Him Home&#8221; are two of the most beautiful ballads in musical theater. The anthem &#8220;Do You Hear the People Sing?&#8221; is one of the most brilliant songs of patriotism ever written. The music and words blend to create a compelling story that thrills audiences at every performance.</div>"
Testlet9130,"Nature’s Partners</h1>In the wild, finding food and staying safe is not always easy. Many plants and animals form relationships to help each other survive. Scientists call these relationships <i>symbiosis</i>. Sometimes, neither partner could live without the other. Other times, both partners could live, but they would not be as healthy. When both partners benefit from the relationship in some way, they have a type of symbiotic relationship known as <i>mutualism</i>. There are many different examples of mutualism.</div>"
Testlet9130,"<div class='paraTitle'>Cleaning for Food</div>One example of mutualism occurs when one organism gets food by cleaning another organism. This is the case with a bird called the red-billed oxpecker and the giraffe. The oxpecker climbs over the giraffe&#8217;s neck searching for ticks and blood-sucking flies to eat. The giraffe is kept clean while the oxpecker is provided with food.</div>The African crocodile and the Egyptian plover also have this kind of relationship, in which the plover acts like a feathered dentist. The crocodile relaxes and holds</div>"
Testlet9130,"its mouth open, signaling the bird to enter and safely feed on parasites and debris. In return, the crocodile&#8217;s mouth gets a cleaning!</div><div class='paraTitle'>Trading Protection</div>Another example of mutualism occurs when two organisms provide each other with protection. In Costa Rica, stinging ants scramble about on large acacia trees, biting animals that try to eat parts of the tree. In return, the trees provide the ants with protected nesting places within their hollow thorns.</div>"
Testlet9130,"<div class='paraTitle'>Staying Alive</div>Sometimes neither organism could survive without the other. An example is the termite and small single-cell organisms called protozoans, which live in the termite&#8217;s digestive tract. Termites live mostly off the dead wood they chew, but they depend on the protozoans to help digest the wood. In return, the termite provides a home for the protozoans. The termite would starve without the protozoans, and the protozoans would die outside the termite.</div>"
Testlet9100,"Bananas: A Most Popular Fruit</h1>Did you know that bananas are one of the world&#8217;s most popular fruits? They may be the most popular fruit in America. According to one of America&#8217;s largest banana distributors, the average American eats 27 pounds of bananas each year. Bananas are the best!</div>Banana plants are grown only in tropical regions, where it&#8217;s very warm and rainy. Over 400 types of bananas are grown, but most of the bananas we eat are just one type&mdash;the Cavendish banana. The Cavendish banana is a sweet dessert </div>"
Testlet9100,"banana that is usually eaten raw. Many other types of bananas need to be cooked before eating. People use banana plants for more than just eating, though. They use the plant&#8217;s leaves to wrap food when cooking. Fibers from the plant can be used to make things such as umbrellas, trays, plates, and baskets.</div><div class='paraTitle'>The Banana&#8217;s Origin</div>Some historians believe that bananas were Earth&#8217;s first cultivated fruit, grown in the area around Malaysia more than 4,000 years ago. Over the years, ancient travelers carried bananas eastward across the Pacific Ocean and westward</div>"

Then, in the early fifteenth century, Europeans brought banana plants from Africa to the Canary Islands and on to the Caribbean and Latin American countries.</div><div class='paraTitle'>A Unique Plant</div>Despite popular belief, banana plants are not trees, but giant herbs that take about a year to grow. The plants are considered herbs because they do not have woody stems like trees do. The plant&#8217;s true stem grows underground. The &#8220;false&#8221; stem that grows above ground is called the pseudostem. The pseudostem is made up of overlapping</div>"
Testlet9100,"leaves wrapped tightly around one another, which allow the plant to conserve water. A narrow stalk grows up through the center of the pseudostem. Tiny flowers grow around the stalk in bunches that resemble fingers on a hand. Bees and bats pollinate the flowers, and each flower grows into a banana. Up to 240 bananas can grow on one plant.</div>"

Testlet9110,"Hydrogen Now!</h1>Imagine a world where cars don&#8217;t consume oil. Imagine a world where cars don&#8217;t produce pollution. This cleaner, greener world could be right around the corner. To make it a reality, we need hydrogen-fueled cars, and we need them now!</div>Hydrogen-fueled cars do not use gasoline. Instead, they use hydrogen, a renewable energy resource, which, when combined with oxygen in fuel cells, produces electricity that makes the vehicles run. Fuel cells are like batteries,</div>"
Testlet9110,"but they do not require recharging. A fuel cell will produce electricity as long as hydrogen is supplied. Just as they do at gas stations now, drivers of hydrogen cars would &#8220;fill up&#8221; at hydrogen fueling stations.</div>The most exciting benefit of hydrogen cars is that they do not release harmful tailpipe emissions. Everyone knows the shortcomings of our gasoline-powered cars&mdash;the oil they burn pollutes the air with large amounts of carbon dioxide. In contrast, the only thing released from a hydrogen car’s tailpipe is water vapor!</div>"
Testlet9110,"Hydrogen is also a widely available renewable resource, found in natural gas and water. A switch to hydrogen-fueled cars would greatly reduce our nation&#8217;s use of scarce and decreasing fossil fuels.</div>The biggest challenge to hydrogen-fueled cars is changing our nation&#8217;s fueling system. Although there are hydrogen filling stations in operation in some parts of America, a nationwide network is required.

Testlet9110,"Creating this vast new fueling system will be an enormous undertaking. Some argue it is simply not possible. To that, I say, take a look at our history: Did we dismiss the possibility of coast-to-coast freight and passenger trains simply because we didn&#8217;t have a system of railroad tracks in place? Did we abandon the idea of plane travel because airports didn&#8217;t exist? The time has come to utilize our good old American know-how and summon our national courage to make this vision a reality, too. We owe it to future generations to get moving. We need hydrogen cars, and we need them now!</div>"

Testlet9040,"Shakespeare, You, and I</h1>When you mention Shakespeare, almost everyone knows whom you mean: William Shakespeare, the great English author who lived more than four centuries ago (1564-1616). He has been called the most ingenious and important writer in the English language. Even in America, where some people nowadays mistakenly assume that his English is too old-fashioned to understand, Shakespeare&#8217;s works have always been popular.</div>"
Testlet9040,"A map of the United States proves it: many American places&mdash;including towns, mines, and canyons&mdash;are named after Shakespeare or one of his characters.</div>But how many English speakers today have read Shakespeare&#8217;s 154 sonnets? Although most can probably tell you who wrote &#8220;Romeo and Juliet,&#8221; &#8220;Hamlet,&#8221; or &#8220;A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream,&#8221; comparatively few have read or seen one of Shakespeare&#8217;s comedies, tragedies, or history plays performed. Yet, even people unfamiliar with his works often quote from them. How can that be?</div>"
Testlet9040,"Although Shakespeare never went to college, he used a vocabulary of almost 30,000 words&mdash;among the largest vocabularies of any writer in English. He also introduced hundreds of catchy phrases that people still use. Have you ever heard that something looks &#8220;as dead as a doornail&#8221; or &#8220;as pure as the driven snow&#8221;? Maybe you&#8217;ve heard that a person can have &#8220;too much of a good thing.&#8221; People refer to their relatives as their &#8220;own flesh and blood.&#8221; Commenting on a teenager&#8217;s eating habits, a mother complains that she&#8217;s being &#8220;eaten out of house and home.&#8221; Referees talk of &#8220;fair</div>"

Testlet9020,"Mercury and the Woodsmen</h1>One day a lumberjack was felling a tree on a riverbank when his axe glanced off the trunk, flew out of his hands, and disappeared with a splash into a deep pool. Stunned by his loss, the woodsman sat weeping and wailing on the riverbank when the god Mercury appeared and asked the reason for his distress.</div>&#8220;My axe has vanished into that dark water,&#8221; the lumberjack cried, &#8220;and it is the tool of my trade.

Testlet9020,"tool, crudely made of wood and iron. The lumberjack was overjoyed to recover it, and Mercury was so impressed with his honesty that he gave the man the gold and silver axes together with his own.</div>When the lumberjack told this story to his fellow woodsmen, one man bristled with jealousy and decided to seek the same good fortune for himself. He went to the riverbank, began felling a tree, and<br/>then&mdash;believing himself to be<br/>alone&mdash;furtively tossed his much-used axe into the river. He was crouching on the riverbank pretending to sob when Mercury appeared as he had done</div>"
Testlet9020,"before. Asking the reason for the man&#8217;s distress and hearing that this lumberjack too had lost his axe in the pool, Mercury dove into the river as before, again bringing up a gleaming golden axe and inquiring if this was the man&#8217;s lost tool.</div>&#8220;Oh yes, that&#8217;s it; that&#8217;s the axe I lost!&#8221; the lumberjack cried, seizing the golden axe greedily. But Mercury, displeased by the lying knave, not only withdrew the golden axe, but also refused to retrieve the one deep at the bottom of the pool.</div>"
Testlet9070,"The Invention of Basketball</h1>Some things are so familiar that people just assume they have always been around. Consider the sport of basketball: have you ever wondered how and when it originated? Basketball was invented by a single person&mdash;James Naismith&mdash;in 1891.</div>James Naismith was born in Ontario, Canada, in 1861. Raised by his uncle after his parents died, James grew up athletic and competitive. After graduating from one college, he enrolled in a university to study religion. Then, in 1891, he accepted</div>"
Testlet9070,"a teaching job at a YMCA school in Massachusetts.</div>Naismith&#8217;s hardest challenge was to teach physical education to a group of male students, some of whom were older than he was. Naismith&#8217;s boss gave him two weeks to interest them in an indoor sport during the winter. The problem was, the students were bored with gymnastics&mdash;the only real sport offered indoors at the school. Naismith tried inventing indoor versions of team sports like soccer, to no avail. Finally, one night, he came up with a better idea: he would invent a brand new game.</div>"
Testlet9070,"Naismith wanted his new sport to be challenging without being dangerous. He decided it should require physical skill and quick judgment, and be played according to a set of 13 rules, which he proceeded to write. It would be played with a ball, by two teams of nine players each, and the teams would score points when they threw the ball into a basket high above their heads.</div>On December 21, 1891, Naismith posted his game rules in the gymnasium and fastened two peach baskets to a balcony 10 feet off the floor. He divided his students into teams, offered them a</div>"
Testlet9070,"soccer ball, and became witness to the very first basketball game. A janitor retrieved the ball each time it landed in a peach basket!</div>Little did Naismith guess that his game would someday become a major sport, played by people of all ages, all around the world. He was just a teacher trying to give his students a game that they would love to play!</div>"
Testlet9000,"Extracting Honey from a Honeycomb</h1>You&#8217;ve seen it&mdash;observing its liquid ways and amber color. You&#8217;ve touched <br/>it&mdash;feeling its stickiness. Best of all, you&#8217;ve tasted it&mdash;savoring the intensity of its sweetness, flavored by flowers. Honey comes in hundreds of varieties, and the flavor of each variety depends on the type of flower from which the bees gather nectar&mdash;so that clover honey, for example, tastes different from lavender honey. But do you know what&#8217;s involved in getting this gift of the bees from the</div>"
Testlet9000,"honeycomb to you? Beekeepers, who raise bees for their honey, use specific tools and equipment, as well as special processes.</div>Extracting honey from a honeycomb is the most time-consuming part of the honey-gathering process. First, the beekeeper uses a heated &#8220;uncapping&#8221; knife to slice off the layer of wax with which the bees have capped, or sealed, the honeycomb cells after having filled them with nectar. The beekeeper places the honey-coated cappings onto a screen in an uncapping tank. Honey oozes from the cappings through the</div>"
Testlet9000,"screen and down to the bottom of the tank, where it drains out through a spout.</div>Next, the beekeeper places the uncapped honeycombs into an <br/>extractor&mdash;a big metal drum, or tank, about the size of a garbage bin, which holds a wire basket inside. The honeycombs go into the wire basket, the extractor lid is closed, and the basket is spun rapidly with a hand crank or a motor. The spinning of the basket forces the honey out of the combs, down the sides of the tank, and out of the tank through a spout. The empty wax combs are left in the basket.</div>"
Testlet9000,"Finally, the beekeeper pours the honey through a screen or cloth mesh and into a large storage tank. In the storage tank, air bubbles and debris rise to the top, where they can be skimmed off. The honey that is left is poured through a &#8220;honey gate,&#8221; the storage tank spout, into containers. While it is a complex process, the rewards are worth every bit of time and energy put into it!</div>"

Testlet1090004,"Wind Energy</h1>The wind is capable of generating electricity, and wind energy is reliable because as long as the sun shines, the wind will blow. The diagram on the following page illustrates how the uneven heating of water and land causes wind.</div>"

Testlet1090004,"However, is wind energy the best answer to the world&#8217;s quest for a clean,  inexpensive power source? With so many factors to consider, the answer is not simple. There are numerous advantages and also a few disadvantages associated with utilizing wind energy.</div><div class='paraTitle'>Advantages</div>One obvious advantage is that wind is a renewable source of energy that does not harm the environment. Wind is free to utilize and is far more sustainable than other nonrenewable sources of energy, such as coal or natural gas. Replacing power plants that use fossil fuel with a large-scale wind turbine will stop the harmful emissions that</div>"
Testlet1090004,"the power plants are pumping into the atmosphere.</div>A power plant takes up a lot of space, while wind turbines take up much less space. This is an advantage that saves money. The base size of the windmill is only a few square meters. This allows the land surrounding the turbine to be used for other purposes. The best sites for wind energy are in rural areas; farmland can surround a turbine without any ill effects on the crops. Wind turbines range in size and can be useful in remote areas, such as mountainous regions.</div>"
Testlet1090004,"<div class='paraTitle'>Disadvantages</div>Even though the sun does initiate wind, wind speeds <u>fluctuate</u> and are unpredictable. In some areas, the wind strength is too low to sustain wind turbines. Generally, the amount of energy produced by wind turbines is less than that produced by the average traditional power plant. To remedy this, multiple wind turbines must be built in order to meet the needs of the area.</div>An added consideration is cost. Although wind energy is free to use, wind energy systems can be very expensive to construct compared to conventional generators. The construction phase can negatively impact surrounding wildlife. For example, the grazing patterns of animals may change.</div>"
Testlet1090004,"Wind energy systems can also be extremely noisy.  The noise pollution from industrial-sized wind turbines is like the sound of a small jet engine. For people living close to the turbines, this is a major nuisance.</div>Furthermore, wind turbines made from metal may interfere with the transmission of television and radio waves.</div><div class='paraTitle'>Judgment</div>Although wind energy has some drawbacks, the <u>substantial benefits</u> outweigh the disadvantages. Nevertheless wind-powered generators do have inconsistent output and may be better used to supplement other sources of energy.</div>"
Testlet1090004,"Solar Power</h1>People all over the world are realizing the importance of earth-friendly energy sources. Solar power is usable energy converted from sunlight. Like other energy sources, solar power has disadvantages. However, its benefits are tempting some skeptics to take a second look.</div><div class='paraTitle'>Advantages</div>Solar power is completely renewable because the sun rises every day, offering a consistent energy source. In addition, harnessing the sun&#8217;s energy does not pollute the air. This is an important advantage of solar energy over oil and other fossil fuels.</div>"
Testlet1090004,"Another significant advantage is that the energy captured from the sun is free! Once installed, solar panels require very little maintenance. This means that once the equipment is in place, the monetary benefits to consumers are substantial. Most equipment systems have a life span of up to 40 years.</div>Some common arguments against other renewable resources include their noise output and displeasing outward appearance. In this area, solar power is better than other alternatives. Solar cells make no noise, and modern systems are becoming less conspicuous. Some even lie directly on the roof like regular roofing materials. Solar panels operate independently; therefore, they</div>"
Testlet1090004,"can be installed almost anywhere. They can be used on remote cabins in the woods, city buildings, and even lampposts.</div><div class='paraTitle'>Disadvantages</div>One obvious disadvantage of solar power is that the sun is not always available. Solar power cannot be created at night; in addition, cloudy days and stormy days limit the amount of solar power that can be created. This restricts how much power can be saved for future days.</div>Another disadvantage deals with aesthetics, or how solar panels look. In order to achieve efficiency, sometimes a large area is needed for installation of solar panels. Some roofs</div>"
Testlet1090004,"look better than others with large panels situated on them.</div>The main argument against solar energy is that solar cells and panels can be very expensive. Purchasing and installing solar panels is costly. The savings will come, but it may take 8 to 10 years to recover the initial costs.</div><div class='paraTitle'>Judgment</div>Solar power technology is improving consistently over time. As nonrenewable energies become scarce, the increased use of renewable energy sources is becoming inevitable.

Music stirs the listener&#8217;s sense of hearing, and he or she may begin to tap his or her toe to the beat or start to dance.

Whenever Internet users surf the Web, they probably see dozens, if not hundreds, of advertisements. Judging only by the sheer abundance of online ads, one might guess that this marketing strategy is phenomenally effective. Research, however, suggests otherwise. Internet advertising has proven far less persuasive to consumers than marketers once hoped.</div>Research data have revealed that few people actually take the bait and instead &#8220;click</div>"
Testlet1020000581,"through&#8221; when they encounter an ad. When advertisers place ads on a website, they are hoping that consumers will interrupt what they&#8217;re doing to follow the link to the product. Studies conducted by one prominent social media website show that ads did not get many clicks at all. Of course, it&#8217;s possible that consumers were influenced by the ad to buy the product even if they didn&#8217;t follow the link right away. However, available data cannot prove in such cases that an online ad made the difference.</div>Part of the problem is that online advertising often targets consumers who were going to buy the product or visit the seller&#8217;s website anyway. <u>For example, when someone runs a search for a cell phone by a major brand, the</u></div>"
Testlet1020000581,"<u>person will likely be shown an ad for that brand right above the search result for the same brand. The consumer is presented with two links to exactly the same website. One of those links probably cost the sellers a small fortune to place.</u> Also, Internet advertisers increasingly have relied on &#8220;tracking,&#8221; using consumers&#8217; email content and search data to target potential customers. If someone has searched for a particular kind of shoe at some point in the recent past, the person is likely to see an ad for that very kind of shoe on the next visit to a social media website. Targeted ads certainly do help sellers reach consumers who are likely to buy the product. On the other hand, most consumers have already decided whether to make the</div>"
Testlet1020000581,"purchase by the time they see the ad. In such cases, an ad&#8217;s influence is minimal.</div>Added to this shoddy marketing strategy is the fact that consumers are more skeptical about advertising in general. These days, people can learn about products through online user reviews, comments, and <br/>price-comparison charts. With a wealth of information available from sources other than the seller, consumers are more likely to question an ad&#8217;s claims. Moreover, &#8220;tracking&#8221; often strikes consumers as an unnerving violation of their privacy. When people feel their personal information is being used for the purposes of marketing, they are likely to leave the website altogether.</div>"

Testlet1020000591,"are generally members of the community. They get to know their customers and therefore feel a stronger commitment to serving them. The personal investment of the owner often means more enthusiastic customer service. A local business is far more likely than a major national chain to bend over backwards in order to please a customer. They might alter the rules of a return policy or negotiate prices, for instance.</div>A variety of local businesses offers a greater selection of goods and services, unlike the somewhat uniform choices presented by chains. Individual shop owners in a local market have their own tastes, which determine the merchandise sold at their stores. They are more likely to understand the</div>"
Testlet1020000591,"products on their shelves and the needs of the local consumer. Thus, they are better able to tailor their supply. On the other hand, national chains have a limited inventory decided upon by marketing specialists far away and disconnected from local needs.</div>A community rich in small businesses is also likely to be rich in many other ways. Small businesses give more to local charity organizations and other community groups. They also reinvest two to three times more of their revenue in the community than big chain stores.</div>Supplies and services are often provided by other local businesses, while the chain store may have suppliers from all over the</div>"
Testlet1020000591,"country. A family-owned restaurant, for example, will probably buy produce from local farmers and use a local accountant for its bookkeeping, but a chain restaurant operating in Kentucky may buy vegetables from Idaho and seafood from Southeast Asia.</div>The cost to the government of maintaining infrastructure, or basic framework, for small, local operations is also significantly less. A local business generally operates in the town center, where roads, utilities, and other necessities are already established.</div>So-called &#8220;big box&#8221; stores, national chains that build enormous facilities on the cheap land just outside of town, encourage sprawl and cost the community more in upkeep. It is</div>"
Testlet1020000591,"far more expensive, for example, to maintain the heavily used, out-of-the-way roads that often lead to big box stores.</div>Moreover, a locally driven economy improves residents&#8217; well-being and quality of life. The presence of many small, local businesses has a positive effect on overall income, resulting in more growth than in those economies where big box retailers reign. In contrast, chain stores tend to depress wages. Studies have also shown that the residents of communities that have thriving small businesses are more informed about local issues, vote more, and participate more in civic affairs. Not only that, but they are less likely to suffer from health problems, such as diabetes and obesity.</div>"
Testlet1020000601,"School Design</h1>On a typical school day, students file into classrooms where they sit at desks. When the class is over, they transfer to new rooms to sit at more desks. This process is repeated until the school day is over, and students close the day feeling fatigued.</div>In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that a decrease in students&#8217; physical activity results in a decreased attention span. Imagine if there were a school where students were encouraged to move more throughout the day. Instead of chairs, students could sit on flexible stools or exercise balls. When it was time to switch classes, they</div>"
Testlet1020000601,"would be encouraged to take a ten minute physical activity break in the large, <br/>multi-purpose common area. What if the school day included running outside to pick vegetables in the school garden so that the cafeteria chef could prepare the produce in a school lunch? What if the students themselves prepared and cooked the lunch menu? In some schools nationwide, this is the reality, and this beneficial model should be replicated at all new schools.</div>In the rural town of Dillwyn, Virginia, the local school district hired architects who were familiar with green design to renovate some old buildings for new use by elementary students. A green building is one that is</div>"
Testlet1020000601,"constructed using healthier and more resource-efficient building materials and construction methods. Architects who plan green buildings are often more innovative and create products that benefit the community. These were the type of architects the people of Dillwyn wanted, as they recognized the need to encourage healthy choices and lifestyles. These architects came up with some new ideas for a school building that encourages healthy activities throughout the day.</div>In a traditional school building, the cafeteria is designed so that the food preparation takes place out of view of the students. In the Dillwyn school, however, food preparation</div>"
Testlet1020000601,"takes place in front of the students. This encourages interest in how food is prepared, and in some cases, students can help with cooking. In a traditional school, the area around the school is limited, but in the Dillwyn school, the building sits on 15 acres of land. Students grow produce in gardens and are able to go outside for lessons and other activities. In the traditional school, learning takes place in the classroom, but in the Dillwyn model, there are learning centers throughout the hallways. These learning centers provide enhanced opportunities for research and exploration. Many drinking fountains are located throughout the Dillwyn school, and there are no soda or vending machines on the premises.</div>"
Testlet1020000601,"The Dillwyn school has not been open long enough to compile long-term data, but it is easy to tell students are happier and also healthier. They are moving more, and cafeteria records show that more fresh fruit and vegetables are served and consumed than before. The model shown in Dillwyn, Virginia, is one that all schools should follow in the future.</div>"
Testlet1020000611,"Protecting Young Athletes</h1>There&#8217;s no arguing with the fact that team sports are popular in the United States&mdash;especially among children under the age of 18. According to one study, only 13 percent of boys and 18 percent of girls between ages 8 and 17 have never joined an organized sports team of some kind. This means that at least 4 out of every 5 American children play on a sports team, and many play in two or three different sports.</div>Thousands of these young athletes will suffer&mdash;or have already suffered&mdash;from a concussion. A concussion is a traumatic brain injury, usually resulting from a blow to the head. This alters the way a person&#8217;s brain</div>"
Testlet1020000611,"functions. Effects of a concussion, such as headaches, dizziness, and an inability to concentrate, are usually temporary but require rest and care until the injury heals. The intense nature of contact sports, such as football and hockey, makes concussions inevitable. For this reason, strict rules must be put into place to protect young players from experiencing serious or lasting damage as a result of concussions.</div>The first challenge for coaches and players is to identify when a concussion has taken place. The brain is an internal organ, and the degree to which any player&#8217;s brain has been injured is almost impossible to detect. It sometimes is not evident until after a game is over that a player has received a concussion.</div>"
Testlet1020000611,"According to a 2014 study in the <i>American Journal of Sports Medicine,</i> almost 70 percent of players with a concussion continued playing after their injury. Furthermore, 40 percent of these players indicated that their coaches were unaware of these injuries.</div>Some people would argue that players know the risks, and they willingly assume them when they take the field. But much research has been done, and more has been learned about brain injuries in the last five years. Leading brain researchers now know that by continuing to play with a concussion, a player risks an even greater injury. Not only are growing brains at greater risk for developing a concussion, but people who experience multiple concussions are at risk of severe</div>"
Testlet1020000611,"physical and academic challenges later in life. So, what can be done to protect young athletes from such injuries? The best solution is to make qualified medical personnel available at every organized game in this country. A concussion expert can quickly diagnose a head injury and would have the authority to remove an injured player from a game at any time. Of course, this will not prevent concussions from happening, nor will it help the athlete who experiences a head injury during practice or at an unorganized pickup game. Also, it is likely that many players and coaches will feel restricted by this rule.</div>In the end, however, the long-term well-being of young athletes must come before any</div>"
Testlet1020000611,"desire to win a game. Now that the experts are connecting the dots between brain injuries and their long-term effects, it is irresponsible to remain silent and ignore this issue any longer.</div>"

On August 28, 1963, an estimated 250,000 people marched to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington where they heard Martin Luther King, Jr., give a speech destined to resonate through the ages.</div>In what became known as the &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech, King gave impassioned voice to the demands of the U.S. Civil Rights</div>"

A sea of white as well as black faces enveloped the Mall,&#8221; the late Dorothy Height, president emeritus of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), wrote in 2005.

Testlet1020000621,"U.S. civil rights history, but also in American history. It resulted in a new determination to move toward equality, freedom, and greater employment for people of color.&#8221;</div>According to Height, &#8220;The real significance of the march, and the speech, was that it changed attitudes. <u>Righteous indignation against racial discrimination became widespread after the march.</u> It led to a time so full of promise and achievement. You could feel it.&#8221;</div>Less than a year after the march, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which banned discrimination in public facilities, such as hotels and restaurants, and also prohibited employment</div>"
Testlet1020000621,"discrimination. The following year, passage of the Voting Rights Act ensured African Americans could freely exercise their franchise<sup>1</sup>. . . . Legislation was complemented by new policies, such as affirmative action, designed to counter the legacy of discrimination.</div>The sweeping legal changes seemed abrupt to some Americans, and U.S. communities struggled to catch up. In a 1963 <i>Newsweek</i> poll, 74 percent of whites said racial integration was &#8220;moving too fast,&#8221; a viewpoint that seems shocking today when attitudes are very different. By 2000, a <i>New York Times</i> poll reported 93 percent of whites said they would vote for a qualified black presidential</div>"
Testlet1020000621,"candidate. More than 60 percent approved of interracial marriage. And 80 percent said they did not care whether their neighbors were white or black.</div>The dream King expressed at the March on Washington is now part of the U.S. political mainstream.

His legacy is commemorated with a memorial in the nation&#8217;s capital, near those dedicated to Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. . . .</div>The universal significance of the events of August 28, 1963, was underscored by Height. &#8220;Wherever I have been in the world these last 40 years, it&#8217;s incredible to me how much</div>"

Testlet1090008,"The Benefits of Bike Trails</h1>The responsibility to make healthy choices ultimately falls on individuals. However, communities can strongly influence how easy or how difficult these choices are. One way for communities to help citizens be more active is to make sure there are safe places to ride a bike. When people have access to biking trails, they&#8217;re more likely to ride a bike instead of drive a car. According to one survey, 40 percent of people said they would commute by bike more often if there were safe, separate, designated bike paths.</div>"
Testlet1090008,"<div class='paraTitle'>Economic Benefits</div>Although building bike trails can be costly, they can provide long-term economic benefits for individuals and communities. By choosing to ride a bike to work or school, people save money on gasoline and car maintenance costs. Some people rely on bike riding as their primary form of exercise, potentially saving them the cost of a gym membership. Communities save, too. Motor vehicles put a lot of wear and tear on roads, which are expensive to repair. In contrast, bikes have minimal impact. <u>They also require much less space for  parking. In fact, one regular parking space can accommodate up to 20 bicycles. Instead of spending money to</u></div>"
Testlet1090008,"<u>provide parking facilities for cars, cities could simply install bike racks and save valuable resources.</u></div><div class='paraTitle'>Environmental Benefits</div>Our wallets aren’t the only things to benefit from bike trails. A higher percentage of bicyclists means cleaner air for everyone because biking reduces pollution. Biking four miles instead of driving the same distance prevents approximately 15 pounds of pollutants from going into the air. A reduction in air pollution could have immediate health benefits, too, because motor-vehicle emissions are linked to increased rates of asthma and other respiratory problems.</div>"
Testlet1090008,"<div class='paraTitle'>Personal Benefits</div>In addition to these  more concrete benefits, there are intangible benefits, too. For example, people who bike to school or work tend to arrive feeling more alert and lively. They say that bike commuting is <u>invigorating</u>. Studies support these claims, showing that regular exercise not only improves our physical health but also improves our moods. It&#8217;s also worth noting that bike trails can make daily commutes more pleasant. <u>Would you rather sit in a car, feeling cramped and  stressed out by all the traffic, or would you rather enjoy the great outdoors, feeling free and alive on your bike?</u></div>"
Testlet1090008,"A network of bike trails connecting neighborhoods with schools, workplaces, and shops makes it much easier for people to bike instead of drive. Although some people are comfortable sharing the roads with motor vehicles, many&mdash;especially families with children&mdash;feel safer using separate bike paths. Providing such facilities would result in more people biking, a choice that benefits them as well as the whole community.</div>"
Testlet1090011,"Living Architecture:<br/>Building a New Future</h1>Lowering our carbon footprint is a global environmental priority. To accomplish this mission, we need to find ways to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere. When the media discusses the main contributors to climate change, they usually focus on things like transportation, household energy use, or even meat production. These industries produce significant amounts of carbon dioxide. However, there&#8217;s another culprit: buildings.</div>"

Testlet1090011,"<div class='paraTitle'>Buildings Have a Large Carbon Footprint</div>Buildings are responsible for 40 percent of our carbon footprint. Building materials must be harvested and processed. These activities release carbon dioxide. Even more carbon dioxide is released during the construction process. Still more is released to keep buildings heated and cooled.</div>To devise ways to lower the carbon footprint of buildings, scientists and architects are <u>collaborating</u>. One architect, Rachel Armstrong, has been leading a team of scientists in exploring a technique called &#8220;living architecture.&#8221; The term &#8220;living architecture&#8221; refers to using biological elements to change the way our buildings affect the environment. Living architecture is</div>"
Testlet1090011,"a different way of thinking about buildings. <u>Right now, buildings mainly consist of inorganic materials, such as steel and concrete. Supporters of living architecture imagine the possibility of creating buildings that share some of the properties of living organisms.</u></div><div class='paraTitle'>Lifelike Protocells</div>Living architecture is based on a new technology called protocells. Protocells are artificial cell-like objects created in laboratories by biochemists. Protocells aren&#8217;t actually alive, and they aren&#8217;t actually cells. However, they do exhibit many of the same properties as living things. Most importantly, protocells respond to their environment.</div>"
Testlet1090011,"In fact, scientists can design protocells to do different things in the environment. For example, some protocells can remove carbon dioxide from the air. They could possibly be incorporated into building materials such as concrete or steel. With these protocells, buildings would function a bit like plants, reducing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Rather than being part of the climate change problem, buildings could be part of the solution.</div>There are numerous other ways protocells can be useful. Some protocells can attract water. Scientists believe that these protocells could be used to collect the dew that gathers on buildings in the morning. This extra water could be valuable in areas with water</div>"
Testlet1090011,"shortages. Protocells could also affect a building&#8217;s temperature by either trapping or repelling heat.</div><div class='paraTitle'>The Future Is Today</div>It sounds like something from a<br/>science-fiction novel. Could we really have buildings that include synthetic particles to control the air quality or temperature? But as Armstrong points out, our current methods of building haven&#8217;t really changed since the mid-1800s. It&#8217;s time to imagine a different future.</div>"
Testlet1090002,"Knowing People Better Through Birth Order</h1>Many researchers believe that birth order is strongly associated with certain character traits. Birth order relates to where a person falls in the order of births in the family.

Testlet1090002,"<div class='paraTitle'>See That CEO? She&#8217;s Probably a Firstborn!</div>As stated, there is a strong connection between birth order and personality.  This connection is so strong that, like foreshadowing in a novel, birth order can give a clue about what comes next.</div>Firstborns are overrepresented in positions associated with very high levels of achievement. For example, more than half of the people who have won Nobel Prizes or served as president of the United States were eldest children. A large number of astronauts and those who work in the fields of law and medicine are firstborns. Winston Churchill, former prime minister of Britain, was the oldest child in his family.</div>"

This theory, however, does not imply that there aren&#8217;t exceptions, or that every youngest child is an exact copy of every other. Rather, birth order theory simply states that patterns exist. Things such as changes in family structure and parenting styles may mean that not everyone will fit the mold. This, however, does not make birth order theory any less valid.</div>"

And instead of being sad and unhappy they began to laugh and sing. &#8220;Behold, the Age of Gold has come again,&#8221; they said.</div>But Jupiter was not so happy.

Vulcan was sorry for Prometheus, but dared not disobey.</div>So the friend of man lay, miserably bound, naked to the winds, while the storms beat about him and an eagle [attacked him] with its cruel talons.
